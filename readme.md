
## Pyphotometry Hardware documentation

pyPhotometry is a system of open source hardware and software for 
neuroscience fiber photometry data acquisition.  

For more information see: https://pyphotometry.readthedocs.io

- The 'Acquisition board' folder contains design files for the acquistion board.  
- The file 'optics_BOM.xlsx' contains a list of external components that can be used with the acquisition board for green/red photometry experiments.

## Ordering parts to build the printed circuit board:

Users interested in building their own boards now can order all components for them using [KitSpace](https://kitspace.org).
  - KitSpace is an open project that makes it easier to put purchase all the electronic components to populate the PCB - instead of clicking every link and adding components to a shopping cart, KitSpace allows for all components to be automatically added in a shopping cart from a specific vendor (e.g RS components, DigiKey, Mouser, etc). There is also the option to order the boards themselves direct at KitSpace from different vendors (PCBWay, JLCPCB, etc).
  
  PyPhotometry can be found on KitSpace [here](#)
